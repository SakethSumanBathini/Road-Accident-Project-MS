The primary output is an interactive dashboard designed to assist stakeholders in exploring accident data, identifying trends, and making informed decisions. This project benefits **government agencies**, **traffic management authorities**, **public safety organizations**, **urban planners**, and **researchers**.

### **Key Objectives of the Overview**:
- **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: The project provides stakeholders with the tools to make informed decisions based on detailed road accident data analysis.
- **Enhanced Road Safety**: It offers insights into accident trends and factors, helping to design interventions that reduce accidents and improve public safety.
- **Strategic Insights**: The analysis identifies key risk factors, such as vehicle type and road conditions, guiding targeted safety measures.

## **2. Key Visualizations**

The Road Accident Dashboard utilizes several types of visualizations, each designed to represent different aspects of the road accident data. These visualizations simplify complex datasets, enabling stakeholders to extract meaningful insights and take action.

### **Types of Visualizations**:

- **KPI Dashboard**:
  - This visualization showcases key statistics, including **Total Casualties**, **Fatal Casualties**, and **Casualties by Car**. By providing a quick overview of critical road safety metrics, it helps stakeholders focus on areas that require immediate attention, enabling faster response and more targeted safety interventions.
